<h1>Welcome to the database for the world called Generic.</h1>

<p>Generic is a planet divided into regions called Wheresits inhabited by beings called Whosits. To preserve the existence of Generic, a number of tasks called Whatsits are required. Whosits perform these Whatsits at any Wheresit. Unbeknownst to the Whosits, each has a predetermined destiny called a Whysit assigned by an unnamed higher-being that oversees Generic. The discrepancies between a Whosit's Whatsits and its Whysit largely determines the overall emotional state, or Howsit, of the Whosit.</p>
